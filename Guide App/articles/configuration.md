## Configuration

Just modify `.env` file.

```
title = "Website title"
description = "Website description"
favicon = "Direct link to favicon"
logo = "Direct link to logo"
subtitle = "Subtitle goes here"
footer = "Footer content, supports HTML"
lang = "language"
icon_url = "URL for icons. Type [NAME] for name"
```

Example icon_url: `https://minecraftitemids.com/item/32/[NAME].png`

**Remember to restart the app after making changes in .env if you are in development mode.**
